We are writing a GUI to display timer bars for buffs detected on a screen capture in Python.
Each buff is an icon within an area of interest on the screen.
The area of interest's coordinates are stored as a list of upper left corners and lower right corners and provided by the user.
A PNG image of each buff will be stored in a folder by the user.
The application will also use OCR to read the timer on the buff when it is found.
The timer bars will be displayed with the image of the buff.
The timer bar for a buff will start at 100% and deplete to 0% as the buff duration elapses.
The timer bars will be sorted by duration.
