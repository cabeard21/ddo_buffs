The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `BuffDetector`: This class will be responsible for detecting buffs on the screen capture using OpenCV's template matching functionality.
2. `BuffTimer`: This class will be responsible for managing the timer for each detected buff.
3. `BuffBar`: This class will be responsible for displaying the timer bar for each buff.
4. `BuffSorter`: This class will be responsible for sorting the timer bars based on duration.
5. `BuffOCR`: This class will be responsible for reading the timer on the buff using OCR.
6. `main`: This function will be the entry point of the application.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, `main.py`.
