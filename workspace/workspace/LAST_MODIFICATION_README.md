The first task is to modify the logging to save the log files in the same directory as the file doing the logging. This can be achieved by modifying the `BuffDetector` class in the `buff_detector.py` file. We will use the `os` module to get the current directory and save the log file there.

The second task is to draw a red box around the area of interest and a green box around any matches found. This can be achieved by modifying the `detect` method in the `BuffDetector` class. We will use the `cv2.rectangle` function to draw the boxes.

Here are the modified files:

buff_detector.py
