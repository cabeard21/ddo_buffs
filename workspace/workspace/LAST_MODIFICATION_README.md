The error is occurring because the `buff` object being passed to the `read` method of the `BuffOCR` class is a tuple, but the `Image.fromarray` method from the `PIL` library expects a numpy array. The `buff` object is a tuple because it is the output of the `detect` method of the `BuffDetector` class, which returns a list of tuples.

To fix this error, we need to modify the `read` method of the `BuffOCR` class to handle the tuple input correctly. We can do this by extracting the image data from the tuple before passing it to the `Image.fromarray` method.

Here is the corrected code:

buff_ocr.py
