The request is to implement the capture_screen function in BuffDetector to periodically capture the screen and update the detect function in BuffDetector to use the coordinates for where to search for the template. 

To implement this, we need to use the Python's pyautogui library to capture the screen. We will also modify the detect function to use the coordinates provided when searching for the template.

Here are the updated files:
