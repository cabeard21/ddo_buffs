The requested functionality is to modify the BuffOCR's read method to save the image to a file for debugging purposes. This can be achieved by using the save method from the PIL library. 

Additionally, to facilitate debugging, we can add logging to the BuffOCR class to log the OCR result and any potential errors. 

Here is the modified BuffOCR class:

buff_ocr.py
