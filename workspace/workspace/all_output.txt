The requested functionality is to modify the BuffOCR's read method to save the image to a file for debugging purposes. This can be achieved by using the save method from the PIL library. 

Additionally, to facilitate debugging, we can add logging to the BuffOCR class to log the OCR result and any potential errors. 

Here is the modified BuffOCR class:

buff_ocr.py
```python
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image
import logging
import os

class BuffOCR:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self.logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
        handler = logging.FileHandler(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), 'buff_ocr.log'))
        handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
        self.logger.addHandler(handler)

    def read(self, buff):
        # Extract image data from tuple
        _, image_data = buff

        # Convert image data to image
        image = Image.fromarray(image_data)

        # Save the image for debugging
        image.save(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), 'buff_image.png'))

        # Read timer
        try:
            timer = int(pytesseract.image_to_string(image))
            self.logger.info(f"OCR result for {buff[0]}: {timer}")
            return timer
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error reading timer for {buff[0]}: {e}")
            return 0
```

This modification will save the image used for OCR to a file named 'buff_image.png' in the same directory as the script. It will also log the OCR result and any errors that occur during the OCR process. 

Remember to import the os module to get the directory of the current script file and to create a logging handler for the BuffOCR class.
