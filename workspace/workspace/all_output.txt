The error is occurring because the `buff` object being passed to the `read` method of the `BuffOCR` class is a tuple, but the `Image.fromarray` method from the `PIL` library expects a numpy array. The `buff` object is a tuple because it is the output of the `detect` method of the `BuffDetector` class, which returns a list of tuples.

To fix this error, we need to modify the `read` method of the `BuffOCR` class to handle the tuple input correctly. We can do this by extracting the image data from the tuple before passing it to the `Image.fromarray` method.

Here is the corrected code:

buff_ocr.py
```python
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

class BuffOCR:
    def read(self, buff):
        # Extract image data from tuple
        _, image_data = buff

        # Convert image data to image
        image = Image.fromarray(image_data)

        # Read timer
        return int(pytesseract.image_to_string(image))
```

We also need to modify the `detect` method of the `BuffDetector` class to return the image data along with the name of the buff. Here is the corrected code:

buff_detector.py
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import os
import pyautogui
import logging

class BuffDetector:
    # ... existing code ...

    def detect(self):
        # Capture screen
        screen_gray, screen_color = self.capture_screen()

        # Detect buffs
        buffs = []
        for name, template in self.templates.items():
            # Use the coordinates to search for the template
            result = cv2.matchTemplate(screen_gray[self.coordinates[1]:self.coordinates[3], self.coordinates[0]:self.coordinates[2]], template, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED)
            _, _, _, max_loc = cv2.minMaxLoc(result)
            
            # Extract image data
            image_data = screen_gray[max_loc[1]:max_loc[1] + template.shape[0], max_loc[0]:max_loc[0] + template.shape[1]]

            buffs.append((name, image_data))
            self.logger.info(f"Match template result for {name}: {max_loc}")

            # ... existing code ...

        return buffs
```

With these changes, the `buff` object passed to the `read` method of the `BuffOCR` class will be a tuple containing the name of the buff and the image data, which can be correctly processed by the `Image.fromarray` method.
